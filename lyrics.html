        <p>Tekstovi Megadethovih pjesama najčešće govore o političkim problemima, neravnopravnosti, ali i o potpuno irelevantnim temama kao što su vještice, vožnja u alkoholiziranom stanju, itd.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Holy Wars... the Punishment Due</h2>
        <p>Brother will kill brother<br>Spilling blood across the land<br>Killing for religion<br>Something I don't understand<br>Fools like me who cross the sea<br>And come to foreign lands<br>Ask the sheep for their beliefs<br>"Do you kill on God's command?"<br>A country that's divided<br>Surely will not stand<br>My past erased, no more disgrace<br>No foolish naive stand<br>The end is near, it's crystal clear<br>Part of the master plan<br>Don't look now to Israel<br>It might be your homeland<br>Holy wars...</p><p>Upon my podium as the know-it-all scholar<br>Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law<br>Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world<br>Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger of God</p><p>Wage the war on organized crime<br>Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines<br>Some people risk to employ me<br>Some people live to destroy me<br>Either way they die... they die!</p><p>They killed my wife and my baby<br>With hopes to enslave me<br>First mistake... last mistake!<br>Paid by the alliance<br>To slay all the giants<br>Next mistake... no more mistakes!</p><p>Fill the cracks in with judicial granite<br>Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinking it<br>Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away<br>I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose<br>And the lack of mercy killings<br>Mercy killings<br>Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings<br>Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Bad Omen</h2>
        <p>Down fell the stars as they splashed into the sea<br>"Mi nomine Baphomet", come dance with me<br>Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites<br>Their master's time has come, the moon is full tonight</p><p>Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast<br>The Devil, who's watching with demon's remote<br>Fire rising, racing in your blood<br>Possessed, naïve, his service is done</p><p>It's the Sabbath, bloody Sabbath<br>Bad omen of the goat<br>Bloody blasphemy</p><p>Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill<br>An orgy's taking place, human blood will spill<br>An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls<br>Satan has their souls, they sing pagan tunes<br>The ceremony is sure to be cursed<br>They wait for his blessings but down comes the worst<br>Their bodies, soulless, a corpse from the grave<br>Their minds are helpless and no one can save</p><p>No one can save<br>No one can save<br>No one can save<br>No one can save, one can know<br>No one can save, one can know</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Peace Sells</h2>
        <p>What do you mean I "don't believe in God?"<br>I talk to him every day<br>What do you mean I "don't support your system?"<br>I go to court when I have to<br>What do you mean I "can't get to work on time?"<br>Got nothing better to do<br>And, what do you mean I "don't pay my bills?"<br>Why, do you think I'm broke?
